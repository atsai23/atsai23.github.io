Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Anna and I currently work as a Cloud Engineer I at Seattle University. I got my start in a tech in a roundabout way, and my background fuels my passion for engaging a wide range of folks to help them meet their needs with technology.

My first job out of college was as a construction engineer for a large public transit project in Bellevue, WA, followed by experience working as a consulting civil design engineer for a variety of new and redevelopment projects throughout the Puget Sound Region. While working as a practicing engineer I found myself drawn to projects with an emphasis on sustainability but found that this was only a small minority of my projects. I had many questions about the bigger issues impacting my work as an engineer and felt I wanted to take my career in a different direction. With this in mind, I decided to pursue a second Bachelorâ€™s degree in Integrated Social Sciences with the goal of better understanding social issues. While in that program I took classes that nurtured my curiosity about social justice and interest in sustainability, but my learning also took me in unexpected directions. I was introduced to data analytics and visualization through a course on social science research methods which sparked an interest in data science and motivated me to pursue a new path. I realized data science would allow me to unite my desire to make a postive impact in my community with my love of technology. This led me to pursue a Masters of Data Science at Seattle University. While in this program I learned how technology can be a force for good through my coursework and my student employment position on the Decision Support team at SU where I was able to put into practice all I was learning about data science making reports and generating insights that helped Seattle University create a better student experience. Since graduating in 2024 I have continued working at Seattle University, first as a Service Desk Technican directly supporting users, and now as a Cloud Engineer focused on maintaining and modernizing Seattle University's cloud infrastructure. 

<b>The summary of all these twists and turns is</b> that I hope to pursue opportunities in IT and data in a environment where I can interact with with a variety of end users and make a meaningful impact on my community.
