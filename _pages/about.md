Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Anna and I am a graduate student in the Master of Science in Data Science program at Seattle University graduating in June 2024. I also work as a Service Desk Technican I at Seattle University. I got my start in a tech in a roundabout way, and my background fuels my passion for engaging a wide range of folks to help them meet their needs with technology.

My first job out of college was as a construction engineer for a large public transit project in Bellevue, WA, followed by experience working as a consulting civil design engineer for a variety of new and redevelopment projects throughout the Puget Sound Region. While working as a practicing engineer I found myself drawn to projects with an emphasis on sustainability but found that this was only a small minority of my projects. I had many questions about the bigger issues impacting my work as an engineer and felt I wanted to take my career in a different direction. With this in mind, I decided to pursue a second Bachelorâ€™s degree in Integrated Social Sciences with the goal of better understanding social issues. While in that program I took classes that nurtured my curiosity about social justice and interest in sustainability, but my learning also took me in unexpected directions. I was introduced to data analytics and visualization through our course on social science research methods which sparked an interest in data science and motivated me to pursue a new path. I realized data science would allow me to unite my desire to make a postive impact in my community with my love of technology. This has been reinforced in my studies at Seattle University where many of our classes and projects focus on ethics and social issues. Additionally, I spent a year working as a data analytics student assistant on the Decision Support team at SU where I was able to put into practice all I was learning about data science making reports and generating insights that helped Seattle University create a better student experience. 

<b>The summary of all these twists and turns is</b> that I hope to pursue opportunities in data analytics and data science in a higher education environment where I can interact with with a variety of end users and make a meaningful impact on my community.
